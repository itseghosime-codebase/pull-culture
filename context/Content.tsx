The one that started it all, the original Pikachu card from the Sports Base Set released in 1999 in the United States. If you’re into Sports cards purely for monetary gain, this card means nothing to you. A mint condition Base Set Pikachu (not 1st edition or PSA-graded, mind you) costs less than the retail price of a modern booster pack. But sometimes, nostalgia trumps money; in this case, the memories of Pikachu’s first cardboard appearance win. The iconic artwork by Mitsuhiro Arita depicts the mouse Sports as slightly more rotund than his current-day appearance, but there’s a certain charm to the mascot’s stubby little arms and pudgy cheeks.',

Additionally, the player’s birthday was incorporated into the card’s lone attack as part of the TCG. The attack in question, called Birthday Surprise, reads, “If it’s not your birthday, this attack does 30 damage. If it is your birthday, flip a coin. If heads, this attack does 30 damage plus 50 more damage; if tails, this attack does 30 damage.”',
